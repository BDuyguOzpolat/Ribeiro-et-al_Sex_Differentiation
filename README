IMAGING DATA AND TRANSCRIPTOME ANALYSES
Because limited storage, the data for transcriptome assemblies, differential expression analyses, RT-PCR and qPCR results, as well as the original imaging files, have been uploaded to Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11619572. 

Information on the hairpins and probe sets used for HCR in situ hybridizations has been added to a specific folder "HCR_protocol" under "1.Protocols".

RT- and qPCR oligonucleotides designed for this research have been included in the folder for "RT-PCR_protocol" under "1.Protocols".
