ADDITIONAL ASSOCIATED DATA

SEQUENCING DATA
RNAseq raw reads are available under Bioproject PRJNA1166191, SAMN43960593-SAMN43960622 (SRA/NCBI)
Gene sequences (mRNA) are available under PQ760176-PQ760177 and PQ758375-PQ758379 (GENBANK/ NCBI)

IMAGING DATA AND TRANSCRIPTOME ANALYSES
Because limited storage, the data for transcriptome assemblies, differential expression analyses, RT-PCR and qPCR results, as well as the original imaging files, have been uploaded to Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11619572. 
Information on the hairpins and probe sets used for HCR in situ hybridizations has been added to a specific folder "./HCR_protocol/HCR_probe_design" in "1.Protocols".
RT- and qPCR oligonucleotides designed for this research are presented in a file "./RT-PCR_protocol/primers-RT-PCR" under "1.Protocols".
