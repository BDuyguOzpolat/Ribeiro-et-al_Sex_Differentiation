## Updated Protocols

This folder contains experimental protocols that have been updated and refined since our previous publication.

The procedures are based on the methods described in:
Ribeiro, R.P., Null, R.W., Özpolat, D.B. (2025) Sex-biased gene expression precedes sexual dimorphism in the agonadal annelid Platynereis dumerilii. Development, 152 (7): dev204513. https://doi.org/10.1242/dev.204513 

Updates include clarifications, optimizations, and minor modifications introduced during subsequent experiments. These changes do not alter the conceptual framework of the original methods but improve reproducibility and usability.

For transparency, the original published protocols should be consulted alongside these updated versions. Related published protocols:
